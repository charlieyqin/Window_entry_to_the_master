RedHat Linux 6.0+ MIRACL i386 installation

Also works OK for Solaris if its x386/Pentium based.

1. Unzip the MIRACL.ZIP file using the utility unzip, into an empty directory

unzip -j -aa -L miracl.zip

The -j ignores the directory structure inside MIRACL.ZIP. The -aa converts all 
text files to Unix format, and -L ensures that all filenames are lower-case.


2. Perform a tailored build of the MIRACL library by opening an X-Term, and 
   typing

bash linux

3. All the MIRACL applications (except RATCALC) can then be built, as 
   desired. Remember to link all C applications to the miracl.a library.
   C++ applications must be linked as well to one or more of big.o monty.o 
   elliptic.o crt.o flash.o object files etc. 
   See the xxx.bat files for examples. Some applications that require 
   floating-point support may also require -lm in the compile command line.


Make sure that your Linux PATH points to the current directory, so that 
executables can be run.

Some programs may require some small changes. For example in schoof.cpp search 
for the comment about "platforms". 

Note that Linux already has (a rather pathetic) factor program. To avoid name 
clashes you might rename MIRACL's "factor" program to "facter", or somesuch.
