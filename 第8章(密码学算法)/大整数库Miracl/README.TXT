  In the subdirectory LIB

  *DOIT.BAT    -    Batch files for constructing libraries and sample progs.
  MIRACL.MAK   -    John Kennedy's UNIX make file
  BC32.LIB     -    Borland C++ V5.5 32 bit flat memory model MIRACL library 
  MS32.LIB     -    Microsoft C 32 bit MIRACL library (for Win95/WinNT)
  MIRACL.A     -    DJGPP GNU C MIRACL Library

  If using 16-bit Borland C++ V5.5 then use BCLDOIT.BAT to build MIRACL.LIB 
  Then copy MIRDEF.H16 to MIRDEF.H, and you're in business. Use BCXDOIT.BAT to 
  build a library for use with MIRDEF.HPC, to provide pseudo 32-bit performance 
  from a 16-bit compiler. BC32.LIB is a true 32-bit flat model library for use 
  with MIRDEF.H32. It was compiled with the Borland 32 bit compiler BCC32. 
  Programs generated in this way require a DOS Extender program (e.g. Borland 
  Powerpack for DOS), or Win32, or a Windows '95/98/NT environment. 
  MS32.LIB is for use with the MicroSoft 32 bit compiler and MIRDEF.H32 
  (for use with Windows95/98 or WinNT).

  Older versions of these compilers may also work with these precompiled 
  libraries (try it and see). If using another compiler then you must execute 
  an appropriate xxDOIT.BAT file to create the MIRACL library. 

  If a pre-compiled library is not available:-

  (1) Determine which of mirdef.h32/mirdef.h16/mirdef.haf/mirdef.hpc is 
      suitable for you, and/or compile and run config.c to automatically 
      generate a suitable mirdef.h.

  (2) If for performance reasons a non-portable version is to be built,
      select suitable assembly language routines from mrmuldv.any, or
      write them yourself (send us a copy!). Even better - produce a
      ,mcs file for the processor and use either the KCM or Comba method.

  (3) Compile and link together the mr*.c components into an object library.
      Also assemble and link in the assemble language component from 
      mrmuldv.any (if needed).
