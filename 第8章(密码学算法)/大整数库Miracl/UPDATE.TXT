Version 4.0

The main changes from the earlier version 3.xx is the introduction of the
MIP, Miracl Instance Pointer. This is to facilitate the development of
multi-threaded applications. The manual has been updated, and a few small 
bugs dealt with.

From a programmers point of view, the main change is that previously Global
variables like IOBASE, must now be accessed via the MIP, so

    IOBASE=16;

gets replaced by

    mip->IOBASE=16;

The MIP itself is returned by mirsys(), so

    mirsys(200,256);

now becomes

    miracl *mip=mirsys(200,256); 


Version 4.01

New example programs pk-demo.c and pk-demo.cpp demonstrate popular public key
methods, viz. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and the RSA public key system


Version 4.1

Support for Elliptic Curve PK Crypto systems. New fast Elliptic Curve module 
mrcurve.c. This will be very fast on an 32-bit Pentium+ if for example MR_COMBA
is defined as 5 in mirdef.h for 160-bit curve (5*32 = 160)

Implementation of Elliptic Curve variant of the Digital Signature Standard.

Montgomery arithmetic now used more extensively internally. 

pk-demo.c/cpp now also implements Elliptic Curve key exchange, and the El 
Gamal PK method.


Version 4.1.1

In mrprime.c -
New trial_divison() function - dual purpose routine to quickly test primality 
status of a big integer.
New nxsafeprime() function - speeds up search for so-called safe primes,
for example a prime p for which (p-1)/2 is also prime.

New Lucus exponentiation module mrlucas.c


Version 4.1.2

Implementation of Complex Multiplication method for the generation of Elliptic
curves (the previously used method has been shown to generate weak curves).

This was implemented from description in Annex to IEEE P1363

Note the free executable CM.EXE

Version V4.1.3

Inline assembly support for DJGPP C/C++ Compiler. 


Version V4.1.4

New module for implementing Brickell et al's method for exponentiation with
precomputation.

New facility for user-specified function called periodically by time-
consuming MIRACL functions. Useful for doing a Windows message-pump, or
responding to real-time events. See set_user_function().


Version V4.1.5

New multiple-exponentiation program powmodn(), calculates 
a^b.c^d.e^f....x^y mod n. Also ecurve_multn() which does the same for 
elliptic curves.

Brickel et al method extended to Elliptic curves.


Version V4.2.0

C version of KCM method implemented. Might be advantageous for extreme RISC
processors with no integer multiply instruction. Ask for C only build in 
config program (you will need to specify a double length type), and follow 
instructions.

Elliptic curve point multiplication speeded up a bit.

C only code improved. Interesting to note that the 32-bit Microsoft C compiler
- using __int64 as a double length type - now generates code that is nearly as 
fast as optimized assembly language (with /O2 flag).

New low level routine muldvd2() introduced - speeds up time critical loops.
See mrmuldv.any



Version V4.2.1

New bmark.c benchmarking program. Shows timings for typical public key crypto 
methods. Useful for comparing MIRACL with other Libraries, and for determining 
the optimal MIRACL build for a particular application.

MIRACL routine entry and exit tidied up, and skipped if MR_STRIPPED_DOWN
is defined.


Version 4.2.2

Implementation of AES encryption algorithm (in fact RIJNDAEL). This is a 
"place-holder" for now until actual AES winner is decided.

Implementation of Cramer-Shoup PK algorithm - see files
crencode.cpp/crdecode.cpp/crsetup.cpp/crgen.cpp

.. and Schoof's algorithm! Counts number of rational points
on an elliptic curve defined over the field GF(p).

Note the free Windows Command Prompt executable SCHOOF.EXE, available from 
download site

Version 4.2.3

Implementation of Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm , for more efficient
elliptic curve point-counting. Again free Windows Command Prompt executables 
(MUELLER.EXE, PROCESS.EXE and SEA.EXE) are available for download.

Version 4.2.4

Schoof and Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm implementations greatly optimized.


Version 4.3.0

Support for Elliptic Curve Cryptography over GF(2^m). ECDSA implemented for 
same - see ecsgen2.c ecsign2.c ecsver2.c. 
The C++ class is implemented in ec2.h and ec2.cpp

Also Schoof's algorithm for point-counting over GF(2^m) curves


Version 4.4.0

By popular demand! Multi-threaded support. Read the new section in the manual


Version 4.4.1

new routines bytes_to_big(), big_to_bytes() for easy conversion between pure 
binary and bigs. Also strong_bigrand() for ease of access to cryptographically 
strong big numbers


Version 4.4.2

New P1363 wrapper/DLL introduced. Lim-Lee prime generation. General tidy-up, 
and more installation help.


Version 4.4.3

Fuller support for new AES (we were right - it was Rijndael). Also 
implemenations of the Lim-Lee algorithm for generating primes, and 
implementations of the new SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA512 hashing algorithms.


Version 4.4.3a

Maintainance release. A few bug fixes. Domain data in 
common.dss/common.ecs/common2.ecs is now in Hex, as Hex is used in the 
standards documents. Schoof fixed for anomalous curves.

New section on error messages in the manual. I/O buffer size is now set
dynamically via set_io_buffer_size() routine - no longer fixed in mirdef.h

Version 4.5

New mechanisms for implementing fastest embedded code. The Comba and KCM
methods have been extended and supported for more compiler/processor
combinations. Through the use of the Macro EXpansion program MEX.C macros
can be inserted into supplied templates. If your compiler supports in-line 
assembly, this is probably the mechanism to use for best performance on
embedded processors. See kcmcomba.txt for more details.

Version 4.6

Internal structure of big numbers changed, from an array to a simple 
struct. Memory alignment problems solved. Support for use of floating-point 
"double" type - see double.txt. More IEEE 1363 and P1363a support.
  

Version 4.6.1

Implementation of Boneh & Franklin's IBE Identity Based Encryption


Version 4.6.2

Extended GCD algorithm speeded by 70%. Some minor bugs dealt with.


Version 4.6.3

Jacobi symbol algorithm substantially speeded up. New program imratio.c
calculates S/M, I/M and J/M ratios

Version 4.6.4

New fast method for assigning C++ Big objects from the stack

Version 4.6.5

New alternative Comba/Kcm macros that "interleave" multiplication steps. This 
should be faster on modern load/store architectures. See makemcs.txt
Complex Multiplication utility for counting points on elliptic curves greatly 
improved. Comba/Kcm macros for 32-bit SPARC implemented - see sparc.txt and 
sparc.mcs. Double base-type code debugged/optimized. Optimizer problem with 
Gnu GCC solved.


Version 4.7

New improved and updated IEEE 1363 support.

Version 4.7.1

New P1363a primitives and methods -  DLPSP-NR2/PV, DLSP-NR2, DLVP-NR2, 
DLSP-PV, DLVP-PV, ECPSP-NR2/PV, ECSP-NR2, ECVP-NR2, ECSP-PV, ECVP-PV, 
EMSA4, EMSR1, EMSR2, EMSR3, DLSSR, DLSSR-PV, IFSSR

New functions memalloc,memkill and mirvar_mem. When many big variables need to 
be created in a C program multiple calls to mirvar can be slow. Better to 
allocate space for all in one heap access. See brent.c and p1363.c for an 
example of use.


Version 4.7.2

Cryptographically Strong Pseudo Random Number Generator interface improved. 
See test1363.c and p1363.c for example of use. It is now possible to allocate 
bigs in C programs from the stack - see brute.c for an example


Version 4.7.3

New style C++ I/O headers supported. C function "round" renamed to "mround", 
"negate" to "negify", to avoid GCC 3.2 name clashes

Version 4.7.4

Base64 I/O supported. Just set IOBASE=64 before input/output
